When using Aggravate, some Electro characters like Keqing, Lisa, Kuki, and Fischl may see damage increases or similar output with EM Sands over ATK% Sands. This is because the above characters have low Talent percent scaling per hit but high hit rate and Electro application. For Beidou, this is not the case and ATK% is better 99% of the time (the 1% being teams where Beidou triggers Transformative Reactions). Beidou has comparatively much larger Talent percent scalings which makes increasing her raw damage through ATK% Sands more worthwhile. That being said, Aggravate is still a good reaction for Beidou; you just do not build specifically for it.
